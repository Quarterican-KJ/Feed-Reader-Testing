# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I needed to use Jasmine to write a series of test suites to run in the Feed Reader.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


# How to Use

You may either clone this repo or you may download a .zip file to your local machine. inspect the .html file to see tests passed by Jasmine.

# Tests That Created

* Tests for allfeeds has been defined and that it is not empty.
* Tests for allFeeds have a url and that the url is not empty.
* Tests for allFeeds have a name and that the name is not empty.
* Searches for the class of 'menu-hidden' in the body tag and checks that the menu is hidden.
* Toggles on click event if the menu appears or disappears.
* Tests if the loadFeed function has at least a single '.entry' within the '.feed' container.
* Tests to see if two entries are not equal.
